### What
This is a sample submission for Outputs 2.0 to enable DOA Fellows produce small incremental and iterative outputs that allow them fulfil the requirements for current CP1 on any project of their choice.

### Why
This would allow facilitators review these produced outputs in bits with clear guidelines on evaluation. This is meant to support scaling the number of fellows facilitators can handle and also help the Learning Department leverage the fellowship at large for evaluation.

It is envisioned that the outputs for this Supercontext would move to pre-fellowship.
