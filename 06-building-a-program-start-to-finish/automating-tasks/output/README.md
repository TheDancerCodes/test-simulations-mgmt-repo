## Automating Tasks

This contains the finished output for automating-tasks output. This feature is built using gulp and browser-sync. It automatically reloads the browser when changes are detected in HTML, CSS and JS files.


Automating browser reload makes it easier and faster to develop products as changes in codes immediately reflects on the browser.

To get started, here are a few things you need to do:
* open your terminal
* clone repo : `git clone https://github.com/andela-iamao/inverted-index.git`
* make sure node and npm are installed.
* type the following commands
 * `npm install -g gulp`
 * `npm install`
 * `gulp runserver`


This is only limited to changes in the HTML, CSS and JS files and it only watches for changes in specified directories.
