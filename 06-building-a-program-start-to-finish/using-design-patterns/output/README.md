#### Output
- **Using**: GitHub
- **Deliver**: a Pull Request showing two Design Patterns (suggestions: Decorator, Factory, Observer, Prototype...) or a detailed explanation of Design Patterns used while `solving-the-problem`
- **With**: *independently*

- **Design Patterns used:**
1. Model-View-Controller : This design pattern divides the application into 3 interconnected part. The Model is the InvertedIndex class, the View is the index.html while the controller is the app.js(Angualar) code. The purpose of MVC is to separate application logic from the actual presentation. It allows for parallel development unlike some other design pattern that requires that one part be completed before the other.

2. Singleton Class Design pattern: This was implemented in the model(invertedindex) class. Singleton avoid multiple instantiation of the class object hence maintaining the consistency of properties, methods and variables of the class.
