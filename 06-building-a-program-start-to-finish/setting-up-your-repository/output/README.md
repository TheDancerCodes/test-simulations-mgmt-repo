## Automating Tasks

This is the repository I will be using to manage my inverted-index project. It currently contains the bare bones of the project. 


To get started, here are a few things you need to do:
* open your terminal
* clone repo : `git clone https://github.com/andela-iamao/inverted-index.git`
* make sure node and npm are installed.
* type the following command
 * `npm install`
